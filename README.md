wordclock
=========

A customizable word clock with to-the-minute granularity. Created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
Inspired by [Biegert & Funk's QLOCKTWO](http://www.qlocktwo.com/info.php?lang=en).

Usage
-----

Usage is simple: Open index.html in your browser.


Customization
-------------

Customize the color scheme by editing the `<nav>` segment in index.html:

    <nav>
        <a href="#black" style="background-color: #000; color: #fff" data-off-color="#333">Black &amp; White</a>
        <a href="#brown" style="background-color: #44301C; color: #9CCFDD" data-off-color="#5E5043">Blue &amp; Brown</a>
        <a href="#red" style="background-color: #DF1A21; color: #FBE1A6" data-off-color="#FB6B58">Red &amp; Cream</a>
        <a href="#blue" style="background-color: #063540; color: #E5D9CF" data-off-color="#176273">Blue Jeans</a>
    </nav>

To add more color schemes, simply copy and paste one of the lines above, then customize to taste. The inline styles define the background and highlight colors for the link itself and the clock. The data-off-color is used for the unhighlighted letters.


Errata
------

wordclock *should* run in the latest CSS3/HTML5-friendly browsers, but has only been testing using Safari (6.0.2), Chrome (16.0.912.77, ) and FireFox ().
